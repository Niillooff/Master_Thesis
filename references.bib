abstract = {The literature of spatial inequalities is currently “fragmented” across ethnic segregation and built environment domains. Inequalities in these dimensions are often considered in isolation one from another. For example, ethnic segregated areas are often more disadvantaged in terms of unemployment, housing conditions and access to services. By using a combination of the most recent Census and a series of openly available datasets related to ambient urban environment characteristics at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) for the 12 biggest cities in England, we employed a series of multilevel models to explore the within and between city variations in the relationship across ethnic segregation, and key socioeconomic and built environment features of neighbourhoods. The results showed that ethnic minority segregated areas are associated with distinct and remarkably systematic patterns of socioeconomic characteristics, but do not lack access to good quality schools and public transport compared to the predominant white population communities. Ethnically segregated communities seem to consistently experience higher unemployment, long-term illness, higher average household size, and high exposure to pollution compared to white population groups across English cities. These relationships are remarkably similar across ethnic groups evidencing the extent of systematic persistent disadvantage experienced by minority communities relative to white populations. Moreover, the strength of these relationships varies widely across cities, although the overall systematic pattern prevails.}

abstract = { We develop and apply a multilevel modeling approach that is simultaneously capable of assessing multigroup and multiscale segregation in the presence of substantial stochastic variation that accompanies ethnicity rates based on small absolute counts. Bayesian MCMC estimation of a log-normal Poisson model allows the calculation of the variance estimates of the degree of segregation in a single overall model, and credible intervals are obtained to provide a measure of uncertainty around those estimates. The procedure partitions the variance at different levels and implicitly models the dependency (or autocorrelation) at each spatial scale below the topmost one. Substantively, we apply the model to 2011 census data for London, one of the world’s most ethnically diverse cities. We find that the degree of segregation depends both on scale and group. }

abstract = { How individuals’ residential moves translate into overall emergent segregation patterns remains a key challenge in neighbourhood ethnic segregation research. In this paper, we use agent-based modelling to explore this concern, focusing on the interactive role of ethnic and socio-economic homophilic preferences and socioeconomic housing constraints as determinants of residential choice. Specifically, we extend the classic Schelling model to a random utility discrete choice approach to simulate the relocation decisions of people. We model different weights for preferences for ethnic and socioeconomic similarity in neighbourhood composition over random relocations, in addition to housing constraints. We formalise how different combinations of these variables could replicate empirically observed ethnic segregation scenarios in Bradford, a substantially segregated local authority in the UK. We initialise our model with geo-referenced data from the 2011 Census and use various measures of segregation to describe our results. As in the original Schelling model, we find that even mild ethnic preferences alone would lead to unrealistic ethnic over-segregation in Bradford. However, we demonstrate that such process can be altered in favour of less ethnic segregation when agents’ preferences for socioeconomic similarity are slightly stronger than their preferences for ethnic similarity. We discuss theoretical and policy contributions of our findings. }

abstract = "{The effect of immigration on social cohesion is a political issue, expressed as a fear that racially skewed residential patterns represent ghettos which prevent integration. Residential patterns have been measured by indices of segregation. The range of indices is reviewed in the paper and measured empirically for England and Wales by using census data for 1991 and 2001, including a new index of migration dispersal. There has been an increase in residential mixing as a result of growing minority populations and their more even spread across localities. These two trends are identified by two commonly used indices of segregation which are moving in opposite directions for the most recent immigrant groups. The sensitivity of each index to modifiable area boundaries makes them unsuitable for evaluation of cities’ relative performance. The residential patterns of cities after immigration are more clearly understood by using demographic measures of migration and age structure.}",

This chapter examines European research on spatial segregation through various social science disciplines, including urban studies, sociology, psychology, spatial and human geography. It presents the range of theoretical approaches employed to explain why people who belong, or are perceived to belong, to dissimilar social categories or to hold different identities become spatially separated from each other, and ways in which this may change. Factors that influence segregation are interrelated. A holistic, interdisciplinary approach to spatial segregation is, therefore, essential to understand such mechanisms and then design policiesPolicy to counter any negative impacts of segregation. Individual and group experiences are shaped by varied contexts, whether residential, work, leisure, transport and daily encounters. This chapter examines approaches to spatial segregation from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and indicates possible directions for future research.},
